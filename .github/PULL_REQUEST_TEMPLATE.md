## 🧩 Pull Request Template

Before submitting your pull request, please go through the following checklist:

1. **Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.**

2. If it's not, ensure that:

   - 🟢 Your changes are done in a **separate branch**.  
     Branch names MUST start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes.  
     **Examples:** `fix/signin-issue`, `feature/issue-templates`.

   - 🟢 You wrote a **descriptive commit message** with a short title (first line).

   - 🟢 You have only **one commit**. If not, squash them into one.

   - 🟢 `npm test` passes without errors. If it doesn't, fix them before submitting (`git commit --amend` helps).

3. **When opening the pull request:**

   - 🎯 Your PR targets the correct branch (usually `staging`, not `main` or `master`).

   - 📝 Provide a clear and descriptive **title** for your PR.

   - 🧾 Describe what you changed and why it matters.

   - 🔗 Use `Closes #xxxx` if your PR solves a specific issue.
